**The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past** will be reissued numerous times on various Nintendo consoles in the future and will also receive a tribute game on the **Nintendo 3DS** called **The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds**, which will take up gameplay ideas, the journey between two worlds, in an original story and some modern gameplay ideas !  


### Description

This remake, made with Solarus, uses the graphic elements of the **Super Nintendo (SNES)** version, featuring characters, enemies, and landscapes from the original game.

With a few differences (mainly due to the modernity of the **Solarus Engine** and the PC system), the game will closely resemble the original discovered on the **Super Nintendo (SNES)**.


### Scenario

**Link** wakes up at home, after receiving a telepathic distress call from a young woman, **Zelda**, *Princess* of the **Hyrule Kingdom** !  

In the midst of a storm, **Hero's** **Uncle** goes outside, armed with a sword and shield, to go to the **Hyrule Castle**.  

**Link** decides to follow him and thus respond to the request of **Princess Zelda**.

This is how you will embody **Link** and thus experience his adventure, saving **Princess Zelda**, as well as the **Kingdom of Hyrule** threatened by **Dark Forces** !


### Gameplay System

This game reproduces the gameplay system of **The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (SNES)** somewhat modernized by the **Solarus Engine** !  

A bit more dynamic, thanks to the PC platform, with modern key assignment system, you can play with a controller or keyboard according to your preferences.
